Examples of how to use the Spout SDK for sharing DirectX textures without using OpenGL.

For all examples, the following source files of the Spout SDK are required :

SpoutCommon.h\
SpoutCopy.cpp\
SpoutCopy.h\
SpoutDirectX.cpp\
SpoutDirectX.h\
SpoutFrameCount.cpp\
SpoutFrameCount.h\
SpoutSenderNames.cpp\
SpoutSenderNames.h\
SpoutSharedMemory.cpp\
SpoutSharedMemory.h\
SpoutUtils.cpp\
SpoutUtils.h  

For examples using the SpoutDX class the following additional files are required :

SpoutDX.h
SpoutDX.cpp

DirectX 11 examples are based on D3D11 tutorials by Chuck Walbourn.\

- Tutorial04 - sender
- Tutorial07 - receiver

There are two versions for each example, contained separately in the following folders :

- Basic\
Stand-alone versions using methods directly from the Spout SDK classes as above. These give details on how the sender shared texture access and copy is managed.
	* Tutorial04 - sender\
	* Tutorial07 - receiver\
	
- SpoutDX\
Versions using the "SpoutDX" support class which contains the detail and presents simple functions for the application. The different versions have separate projects for Visual Studio 2017 and can be built independently.
	* Tutorial04 - sender\
	* Tutorial07 - receiver\
- Windows examples\
Based on a simple Windows Desktop Application project generated by Visual Studio and adapted to use the SpoutDX support class. These examples demonstrate SendImage and ReceiveImage to transfer image pixels to and from shared DirectX textures. They are unique in that no DirectX or OpenGL is used by the applications themselves.
    * Sender\
    * Receiver\

The example project files were created with Visual Studio 2017. To build them, retain the folder structure of the Spout distribution. The Spout SDK files should be in a folder "SpoutSDK" as follows :

      SpoutGL <- this folder has all the Spout SDK source files in it for OpenGL. 
	  SpoutDirectX <- this folder is for examples and the SpoutDX support class
	      Basic <- basic DirectX 11 tutorial examples
	          Tutorial04 <- DirectX texture sender
	          Tutorial07 <- DirectX texture receiver
	      SpoutDX <- the SpoutDX class
			  SpoutDX.cpp
			  SpoutDX.h
	          Tutorial04 <- DirectX texture sender
	          Tutorial07 <- DirectX texture receiver
              Windows <- Windows examples
			      Sender   <- Image sender
			      Receiver <- Image receiver
			  
Open each solution file, change to release and build. For all examples, search for "SPOUT" to see the changes made to the original code. Try them first from the Binaries folder.\
Refer to SpoutDX.pdf for further information.
