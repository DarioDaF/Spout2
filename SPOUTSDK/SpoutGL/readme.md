SPOUT SDK

This folder contains all the source files necessary for your C++ application to use the Spout SDK. You can also use a dll if you prefer.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://spoutgl-site.netlify.app/) for details on how to build an application using the SDK source files and how to build and use the SDK as a dll.

The ["SpoutLibrary"](https://spoutlibrary-site.netlify.app/) C-compatible dll be used for compilers other than Visual Studio.

The "SpoutDX" class is designed for DirectX 11 applications rather than OpenGL.
