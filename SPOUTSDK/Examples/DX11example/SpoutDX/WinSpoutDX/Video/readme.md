This is a simple Windows application generated by Visual Studio and modified to use FFmpeg to load a video, decode individual frames, send to Spout and display using Windows functions.

The application itself does not use DirectX or OpenGL and demonstrates the use of "SendImage" which is the only Spout function required. SendImage handles pixel buffer creation and re-allocation as well as sender creation and update. The only other useful option might be to provide a unique name for the sender but this is not strictly required, the executable name is used by default.

FFmpeg.exe, FFprobe.exe and an example movie are required. Find the example Binaries folder. Copy the entire DATA folder to the folder containing the executable file. This may be for example "..\DX11example\SpoutDX\WinSpoutDX\Video\x64\Release". You will then have two sub-folders :

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DATA\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FFMPEG\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOVIES

* Go to https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/
* Choose the Windows static build and download the archive.\
* Unzip the archive and copy bin\FFmpeg.exe and bin\FFprobe.exe to : DATA\FFMPEG

After the program has started, you can use File < Open to load different movie files.
