Examples of how to use the Spout SDK with DirectX textures without using OpenGL.\

The following source files of the Spout SDK are required :

SpoutCommon.h\
SpoutDirectX.cpp\
SpoutFrameCount.cpp\
SpoutSenderNames.cpp\
SpoutSharedMemory.cpp\
SpoutUtils.cpp\
SpoutDirectX.h\
SpoutFrameCount.h\
SpoutSenderNames.h\
SpoutSharedMemory.h\
SpoutCopy.cpp\
SpoutCopy.h\
SpoutUtils.h  

Examples for DirectX 11\
Based on D3D11 tutorials by Chuck Walbourn updated for Visual Studio 2017 and the Windows 10 SDK.
 https://github.com/walbourn/directx-sdk-samples/tree/master/Direct3D11Tutorials

Tutorial04 - sender\
Tutorial07 - receiver

The default example source files are stand-alone versions using methods directly from the Spout SDK classes as above. They are saved as "Tutorial04_Basic.cpp" and "Tutorial07_Basic.cpp" in the respective Source folders.\
Compare with versions using the "SpoutDX" support class "Tutorial04_SpoutDX.cpp" and "Tutorial07_SpoutDX.cpp".\
Copy the required file to the build folder and rename to "Tutorial04.cpp" or "Tutorial07.cpp" as required.

Basic Windows example
WinSpoutDX is a simple Windows Desktop Application project generated by Visual Studio and adapted for Spout input (http://spout.zeal.co/) using the SpoutDX support class. This example receives to a pixel buffer and displays the output using Windows bitmap functions. The purpose is for example rather than practical use. Performance is limited by CPU processing and Windows Bitmap functions.

To build these examples, retain the folder structure of the Spout distribution.\
The Spout SDK files should be in a folder "SpoutSDK" two levels above the example solution folder.

      SpoutSDK <- this folder has all the Spout SDK source files in it 
	  Examples <- this folder is for Spout examples
	      DX11example <- the complete DX11 example folder
		      SpoutDX <- the SpoutDX support class
			      .
				  .
		      Tutorial04 <- DirectX sender example
		          Tutorial04.sln <- Visual Studio 2017 solution
				  .
				  . 
		      Tutorial07 <- DirectX receiver example
		          Tutorial07.sln <- Visual Studio 2017 solution
				  .
				  .
		      WinSpoutDX <- Windows receiver example
		          WinSpoutDX.sln <- Visual Studio 2017 solution
				  .
				  .

Open the solution file, change to release and build either x64 or x86.

Search or "SPOUT" to see the changes made to the original code.
