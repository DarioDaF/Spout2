Examples of how to use the Spout SDK with DirectX textures without using OpenGL.\

The following source files of the Spout SDK are required :

SpoutCommon.h\
SpoutDirectX.cpp\
SpoutFrameCount.cpp\
SpoutSenderNames.cpp\
SpoutSharedMemory.cpp\
SpoutUtils.cpp\
SpoutDirectX.h\
SpoutFrameCount.h\
SpoutSenderNames.h\
SpoutSharedMemory.h\
SpoutCopy.cpp\
SpoutCopy.h\
SpoutUtils.h  

DirectX 11 examples\
Based on D3D11 tutorials by Chuck Walbourn updated for Visual Studio 2017 and the Windows 10 SDK.
 https://github.com/walbourn/directx-sdk-samples/tree/master/Direct3D11Tutorials

Tutorial04 - sender\
Tutorial07 - receiver

The default examples are stand-alone versions using methods directly from the Spout SDK classes as above. Compare with versions using the "SpoutDX" support class.\n
The different versions are saved in the respective Source\Basic or Source\SpoutDX Source folders. To change examples, copy the required file to the build folder and replace the existing one. The different versions are also renamed and saved separately in the respective folders to avoid overwriting.

Windows examples\
WinSpoutDX is a Windows Desktop Application project generated by Visual Studio and adapted for using the SpoutDX support class.\
The receiver receives to a pixel buffer and displays the output.\
The sender displays an image, captures the screen to a sender pixel buffer.\
The default example is a sender. The different versions are saved in the Source\Sender or Source\Receiver folders. To change examples, copy the required file to the build folder and replace the existing one. The different versions are also renamed and saved separately in the respective folders to avoid overwriting.

 The different versions are saved as "WinSpoutDXsender.cpp" and "WinSpoutDXreceiver.cpp" in the respective Source folders.\
To change examples, make a copy of the required file and rename it to to "WinSpoutSDK.cpp". Copy it to the build folder and replace the existing file.

To build these examples, retain the folder structure of the Spout distribution.\
The Spout SDK files should be in a folder "SpoutSDK" two levels above the example solution folder.

      SpoutSDK <- this folder has all the Spout SDK source files in it 
	  Examples <- this folder is for Spout examples
	      DX11example <- the complete DX11 example folder
		      SpoutDX <- the SpoutDX support class
			      .
				  .
		      Tutorial04 <- DirectX sender example
		          Tutorial04.sln <- Visual Studio 2017 solution
				  .
				  . 
		      Tutorial07 <- DirectX receiver example
		          Tutorial07.sln <- Visual Studio 2017 solution
				  .
				  .
		      WinSpoutDX <- Windows example
		          WinSpoutDX.sln <- Visual Studio 2017 solution
				  .
				  .

Open the solution file, change to release and build either x64 or x86.

Search or "SPOUT" to see the changes made to the original code.

Try them first from the Binaries folder.
